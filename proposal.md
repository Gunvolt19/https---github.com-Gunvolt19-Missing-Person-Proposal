# Missing Persons

## A mobile app where people can use to post their missing relatives, friends, etc. and also inform other users if you found what they're looking for.

### Statement of the Problem
We always see some posters about missing persons in electricity poles, public walls, etc. When it rains, these posters are destroyed especially when they were made in paper rendering the posters posted useless.

### Proposed Solution
Our app will attempt to solve the problem with the use of the following features:

1. Login using Facebook or Twitter authentication API. We decided to make our login this way so that it will be easy for the users as they may already have accounts on the following social media.

2. Post your missing person. Upload image of your missing person. Write a description so that other people can identify the missing person.

3. Private messaging. If someone has found your missing person or vice versa, you can communicate via private message for confirmation and judge if the user is not using a dummy or fake account. Alternatively, you can confirm this to your local police station if necessary.

### Target Users
The app will be made specifically for users who have missing relatives, friends, etc. We may even include the police as a target user for the app so that they can see the list of missing persons and use it as reference for their mission.

### Benefits
The app can produce the following benefits:

1. To the users who are looking for their missing person/s. They can easily post the details of the missing person using their mobile phones. No need to print the details in a paper and post it everywhere.

2. To the users who found the missing person. They can easily contact the people who are looking for the person you found using the private message feature.

3. To the police. They can use the list of missing persons as reference that may help their mission/investigation.
